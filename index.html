    <h1>Hello World!</h1>

    <h3>About me</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Name: Alexander Donald</li>
      <li>Year of School: Junior</li>
      <li>Major: Computer Science</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why am taking Critical Web Design?</h3>
    <p>I am taking this class because I want to further my knowledge of web
      applications. I have some experience, but I would like to become more comfortable
    and more capable of making advanced applications. </p>

    <h3>What experience do I have creating content for the web or programming?</h3>
    <p>I have done some very basic HTML and CSS websites. Most of my experience with making
    applications came last semester when I learned how to create mobile applications
     with React Native. Because React Native relies heavily on Javascript and the concepts of
     HTML and CSS, I learned these skills before building the apps. </p>

     <h3>What are my goals for this course?</h3>
     <p>I would like to build off the basic application development skills and knowledge that
     I currently have. Therefore, I would like to build complex applications that relate to my interests. </p>

     <h3>Describe the learn computing activity you did.</h3>
     <p>I picked the keyboard shortcuts learn computing activity because it sounded useful and is something
     I don't know a ton about. It was cool reading about all the different short cuts and seeing them in action.
     A couple that I have never used but seem very useful are Ctl + N (creating a new document), Ctl + O (opening
     a document), and Shift + Ctl + T (reopening a closed tab). The reopening a closed tab shortcut may not be
     used often, but it seems like it has the potential to save you a lot of time. I also realized that you
     are able to select a line of text by triple clicking. Although I have done this many times, I never actually
     understood what it was doing/why it was doing it.</p>

     <h3>Websites that I consider interesting</h3>
     <ol>
       <li><a href="https://www.carolinasportsman.com/" target = "_blank">Carolina Sportsman</a></li>
       <p>I find Carolina Sportsman an interesting website mostly because of the content provided.
       I don't think the website itself is artistically fancy, but there are tons of articles on a variety
        of topics organized well by categories. I am a big fisherman so I really enjoy the content and media
        on this page.</p>

        <li><a href="https://www.espn.com/" target = "_blank">ESPN</a></li>
        <p>ESPN is probably one of my most visited sites. I am a big fan of sports and ESPN is one of
        the best websites to find the most updated scores and news. ESPN is definitely a "prettier" website
        than Carolina Sportsman but that is much more important for them since there are many competitors in
        the sports world. Therefore, you want your website to stick out visually.</p>

        <li>Social Media Platforms</li>
        <p>I think social media applications such as Instagram and Tik Tok are very interesting because of
        how sophisticated they are. Obviously these applications are appealing to the eye, but more important
        to their success nowadays is the data and algorithms behind them. The algorithms created from user
        data create feeds remarkably close to your interests (previous searches/views/etc).</p>

    <blockquote>"A "Hello, World!" program generally is a computer program that outputs or displays the message
    "Hello, World!". Such a program is very simple in most programming languages, and is often used to illustrate
    the basic syntax of a programming language"</blockquote>
